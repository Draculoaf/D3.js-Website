          Critical Reflection On Proposed UI and UX
        </h1>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Creating a user interface which is user centred is important in
          allowing users to stay on a website. It is an investment which can
          provide more clicks onto a website, as it predicts the needs of users,
          and allows for easier problem solving. A user interface which reduces
          cognitive load, provides feedback and is consistent, amongst other
          things, becomes important for all websites and applications (Goldberg,
          2022). The remainder of this essay will reflect on the user interface
          of the website being built for WSOA3029A in accordance with design
          principles from various sources (In The Loop, 2021), (UX Pin, 2010),
          and (Wong, 2020).
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Consistency</h2>
        <p>
          Consistency within user interface describes the familiarity of
          patterns with which a user interacts on a website (In The Loop, 2021).
          Reflecting critically on the design of the website created, this
          principle is used. The navigation bar is consistently on the left side
          of the screen, and on smaller screens the burger button is
          consistently on the top left corner. A section in which users may
          become confused, is when they use the cards because the options in the
          navigation bar change from “home, blog, design, etc” to “home, blog
          one, blog two, etc”. However, this is consistent when interacting
          within all the cards.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Shortcuts</h2>
        <p>
          There are no shortcuts within the website. Shortcuts allow users to
          easily move through the user interface without clicking (In The Loop,
          2021), and could be things such as the copy and paste commands.
          However, within the website for this course, this element might not be
          necessary, as it is primarily a read and scroll website. For all
          intents and purposes, there is a back to top button at the end of
          pages with lots of reading. Furthermore, there are plans to add a
          search bar to the navigation bar, which will take users immediately to
          the items(s) they are searching for.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Feedback allows user to know how they are interacting with the
          website, and if they are interacting with it. On the website being
          built, when users hover over the navigation bar options, the text
          turns slightly lighter grey, similarly, when users hover over the blog
          card it slightly enlarges and has a shadow to “pop out” of the screen.
          Furthermore, the cursor changes from a triangle clicker to an index
          finger pointer. Other things which could be implemented would be a
          loading screen and an error page for potential problems.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Dialogue</h2>
        <p>
          This feature as described as telling the user what their interaction
          has led to (Wong, 2020). For the website this could be seen in the
          underlining of the name of the page in the navigation bar, to indicate
          to users where they are. Something which could be implemented is a
          footer which indicates the end of the page and has information such as
          copyrights or a link to the website’s creator(s).
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Clarity</h2>
        <p>
          Upon testing this, it seemed that users knew how to move through the
          website by using the navigation bar. This was a sign that their
          understanding of the how the website should function, correlated with
          is functioning. The navigation options are set up in a list style,
          thus users might be enticed to move through it and click on every
          option. Users, however, were confused about where the navigation
          options would lead. To resolve this, perhaps a description about what
          ach page contains, may be useful. Users understood what is clickable
          and what is not. On the home page, the heading a big description in
          the middle of the page, caught the tester’s attention. It can be noted
          that the tester behaved and thought about the website in comparison to
          their other website experiences – this is an element of familiarity,
          which reduces cognitive load and increases user retention.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">User control</h2>
        <p>
          On the website being built, there is some user control through the
          navigation bar, however, there is no back buttons. As an improvement,
          this could be added, along with a way to quickly navigate out of the
          blog pages.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Information hierachy</h2>
        <p>
          The website does not make use of colour, size or fonts to show
          importance within the information hierarchy. This should be
          implemented, particularly within the headers and other elements within
          the blog content and home page. In terms of negative space, the
          website makes use of this to make reading more comfortable.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          Although the website makes use of alternative text within the HTML, it
          is difficult to gauge if this text is useful. Overall, the website may
          not be accessible. Whilst it does not use colours as its primary way
          to communicate with users, some less abled users may struggle to
          navigate through the website if they cannot use a mouse, in addition
          to this, they may also struggle to easily visualise the website if
          they are using screen readers.
