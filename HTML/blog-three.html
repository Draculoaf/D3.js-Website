        Summary of What is Interaction for Data Visualization
      </h1>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Research methods</h2>
      <p>
        In the article What is Interaction for Data Visualization by Evanthia
        Dimara and Charles Perin (2020), the concept of interaction within data
        visualisation is explored and studied. The gathers data and forms
        information in various ways. The first is through a survey in which they
        asked visualisation experts and researchers for: papers on the
        definition of interaction in data visualisation, relevant papers on
        interaction as a broader topic, the number of years they have in
        visualisation, and to rate their interaction experience, describing how
        often their own papers focus on interaction. This survey included
        definition research papers, and these papers were included if they had
        sufficient impact and relevance (which the researchers calculated
        through a paper’s forward and backward references). The researchers then
        catagorised the data into tags which described the nature of the paper’s
        which were included and suggested (eg. Complaint paper, definitional
        paper, interactive pipeline, etc).
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Definitional research papers</h2>
      <p>
        The papers suggested in the survey by researchers show that interaction
        for visualisation must involve external entities such as the user and
        the data, external action-reactions between the user and the
        visualisation system, internal actions from the user through cognitive
        actions (reasoning and analytics), and internal entities such as intent
        and time. However, interaction in visualisation is not limited to the
        aforementioned things. It can also involve external entities such as a
        mouse, keyboard, etc; internal entities such as prior knowledge, skills,
        etc; external actions such as filtering tools which change the data and
        provide new representations; internal actions such as memory encoding,
        simulative reasoning, etc. Interaction, which is a goal focused activity
        that contains sequential, incremental and iterative semantics, has
        properties of granularity, discrete and continuous interactions, and
        direct and indirect interactions.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Benefits and critiques papers</h2>
      <p>
        Interaction in visualisation is positively seen as a means to amplify
        understanding of data and enhance exploration of said data. Furthermore,
        it is a means for users to remain in control of how they experience the
        data by leveraging natural abilities, thus becoming more accessible to
        broader audiences. However, interaction is rarely the focus when
        designing visualisations, and visualisation systems are inflexible.
        Additionally, it both overfocuses and fails to focus on user goals. The
        downfalls of interaction in visualisation seems to be due to
        technological challenges, costs, limited modalities and more.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Interaction concept papers</h2>
      <p>
        These results show the types of approaches there are to creating
        interaction in visualisations. A system-centric approach focuses on the
        system operations. This approach has specific domains, and an organised
        network which is in a hierarchy. However, this approach does not specify
        the role of the user or how they interact. The task-centric approach
        describes the low-level tasks of interaction which are data types such
        as roles, means, targets, etc. and whilst low high-level visualization
        tasks build on low-level interactions, the boundaries between low,
        intermediate and high-level interactions are not defined. A
        human-centric approach thinks about interaction in terms of user-intent.
        This approach contains high-level cognitive activities such as insight,
        meta and provenance actions, but assumes a high-level of users intent
        which can be considered within a specific context. An approach like this
        can become very broad and thus lead to more questions of how it can be
        used to accommodate wider spectrums of user intents.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Visualisation pipeline papers</h2>
      <p>
        The papers from this section stressed that interaction could affect all
        levels of the visualisation pipeline. However, they each had different
        focuses. Some papers focused on categorisations of transformations
        according to which level they affect. Other focused on interaction
        techniques and others on categorisations of interaction. The
        visualisation pipeline framework is system-centric and therefore does
        not include user intent. Furthermore, it is not flexible enough to
        describe which interactions are available to a user.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Visualisation and HCI</h2>
      <p>
        Visualisation and HCI are two views of interaction design. Within
        visualisation, interaction is seen as a dialogue between the user and
        the system about the data. HCI also has dialogue, which is channelled
        through input and output from a computer. This dialogue should provide a
        strong sense of control (through the use of tools) and understanding for
        users – both of which should minimise errors and maximise the user’s
        capabilities. Furthermore, the dialogue should be an error-free
        transmission of data. HCI further states that the technology should feel
        natural for the user to use and should provide them with a satisfying
        experience which meets their expectations. By creating user profiling,
        designers may be able to create more tasks which are supported and make
        an overall more inclusive experience. Visualisation and HCI have some
        key points of difference. For starters, visualisation considers data
        within its interactions; HCI has a performance focus, whereas
        visualisation has a user engagement and analysis focus; visualisation
        believes intent evolves whereas HCI believes that intent is formed
        externally; visualisation builds understanding whilst HCI wants users to
        interact with all levels of the pipeline.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Good practices of interaction in visualisation are similar to the
        practise of good user interface. Like in visualisation, users should be
        able to intuitively use your interface, and when they interact with the
        interface, it should provide results which are to a user’s expectations.
        Whilst the context in which these are applied might differ; I feel that
        the concept remains the same: ultimately a designer is creating their
        interface to be satisfying for the user, and easily accessible for broad
        audiences.
