      <h1 class="p-article-title">Prototype Two</h1>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Responsive navigation</h2>
      <p>
        As previously stated in the design document of prototype one, this
        website contains a navigation bar on the side of the screen. To keep
        this consistent, when the website is respondeing to smaller screens, a
        navigation tab may be opened through use of the burger button on the top
        left corner. Additionally, it may be closed by a cross button on the top
        right corner of the navigation panel. The layout of the navigation bar
        being consistently being on the left hand side, is imperitave in
        creating a convention within the website. I plan to add a footer at the
        bottom of the pages, to indicate the end of the page to users, as it may
        feel like the page has no ending. Furthermore, the cross to close button
        on the navigation bar and the burger button to open the navigation bar,
        relies on website conventions.

      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Font and colours</h2>
      <p>
        The font and colour have not changed from prototype one. The font is
        used primarily for readability and understanding, whilst the colours
        provide a minimal look which is still appealing and clean. Other
        colours, which are not black and white, pop out much more in this
        format, and become much more visually appealing. Additionally, other
        small changes become more noticable, such as colour changing on hover.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">Data visualisation page</h2>
      <p>
        In the wireframe for the data visualisation page, there is space for a
        description of more information about the data graphs. This is important
        to not only contextualise the information, but also to provide an entry
        point for users to interact with the page. The colours of the graphs
        will not be black and white, and will make use of a variety of colours
        in order to stand out.
