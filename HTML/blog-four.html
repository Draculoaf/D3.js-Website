      <h1 class="p-article-title">A Reflection on Data Art</h1>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">What is Data Art?</h2>
      <p>
        According to <cite>Kirell Benzi (2020)</cite>, data art is a data set
        which is conveyed through artist practises to elicit emotions from the
        audience. This can take the form of music, interactive pieces, images,
        etc.
      </p>
      <h2 class="p-sub-head">My Data Art</h2>
      <p>
        For my data art, I want to format the data in a way which makes it look
        like the object. For example, with my dataset about sugar content in
        drinks, I will make the data set into the format of a soft drink can.
        Attached below is an example of this:
      </p>
      <p class="u-image">
        <img
          src="/D3.js-Website/Images/number.jpg"
          alt="Image of artworks made of numbers"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel as though this method of representing the data set will make it
        less abstract. With a graph, the data seems to show a narrative in which
        it is saying and comparing the amount of sugar between each drink.
        However, with this data art, it has more of a narrative which shows the
        component as a part of the drink â€“ perhaps having an effect which is
        more warning. Overall, I would like my data art to be a more enticing
        way of representing the data set without losing the numerical-ness of
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that in some ways, the data set may lose meaning when it is
        transferred into the artistic format, because the numbers might become
        too small to be readable. However, I believe this could be easily solved
        by enlarging the image or the text of the data contained within the
        artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        This artwork is, not only to display a data point from the data set in
        "data visualisation", but also to represent the thought process of
        someone with an eating disorder and how they might view the contents of
        food. For example, they may only focus on the fat content of a packet of
        chips, and all they see when they look at it, would be that number.
