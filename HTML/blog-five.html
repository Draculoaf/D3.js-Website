      <p>
        This essay will conduct a close reading of various artworks and
        determine their relationship between data art and data visualisation,
        and their strategies of representation. According to Kirell Benzi
        (2020), data art is a data set which is conveyed through artist
        practises to elicit emotions from the audience. This can take the form
        of music, interactive pieces, images, etc. Because data art is art and
        it can thus be understood differently based on a viewer’s context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sabine Roeser in the article How Art Can Contribute to Ethical
        Reflection on Risky Technologies, suggests that techno-art (ie. art
        which reflects on and engages with risky technology) can be used to
        enhance understanding and broaden a person’s perspectives. As such, she
        believes that this will lead to better technological innovations because
        they will be made with more compassion and kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within explorations of techno-art, various artists have produced works
        which primarily focus on either the embracing of technologies (as
        enhancements for people, or as objects which create a more efficient
        society) or the warning of rapid technological development (shown in
        works where robots take over the world or humans become addicted to
        technology). Roeser explains that works such as these, provide audiences
        with creative perspectives on topics and reflections on issues within
        society, however, she argues that these are the necessary aspects which
        provide people with deeper moral insight. One of the most recent
        examples, I think, of something which questions morals within the
        creation of technology is the claims of sentience of a Google AI
        programme (Maruf, 2022). AI programmes which are able to “learn” by
        recognising their errors and changing their behaviour, could be argued
        to have some human characteristics, however, the boundaries blur more
        when programs are able to be “creative” or “perceive themselves”. This
        brings into question the ethics of testing on a sentient being, and how
        its creators should care for it, but it is also a reminder of the
        dangers of this technology. However, I feel that these programs are the
        representation of algorithms who take data and reflect learned qualities
        which could be perceived as human. Thus, when we represent data in ways
        which feel innately human, we reflect on our moral philosophies (Roeser,
        2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernanda B. Viégas and Martin Wattenberg (2007), however, believe that
        messages are embodied within the data art itself. Unlike Roeser who used
        examples of techno-art, Viégas and Wattenberg believe that data art
        should be based on the data itself. The artwork thus produces a new
        perspective of the data. Viégas and Wattenberg present a similar
        data-artwork as the figure below which takes the average colours of the
        frames within a movie, and places the in one image as long strips.
        Within the Harry Potter films, we can see from this strip all the
        moments of darkness and the sudden moments of light within it – a
        pattern which is reminiscent of the mantra “out of darkness comes
        light”. I believe that this is what Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) were
        saying about the way in which data-art can reveal messages which might
        not always be obvious just by analysing the data alone. There should be
        some brainwork in which the viewer must apply their own context and
        thoughts into the decoding of the artwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the prevalent concepts which is frequently mentioned throughout
        both of the previous articles, is this constructionist idea (Hall, 1997)
        that meaning is created and not inherently found within artefacts
        (objects) and signs (languages, images, etc). The decoding of these
        signs in order to understand its message is affected by one’s own
        personal biases and context. However, one must also consider the history
        (which would reflect biases of the time period), presentation, and
        creation of the artefact (Kidd, 2015). All of these factors contribute
        into the intended meaning by the creator in comparison to the meaning
        which one might decode from it. Because meaning is created, artefacts
        play a large role in both how people identify themselves, but also how
        they identify others. Historically, the people in power were the primary
        creators of this identity relationship. However, this meant that people
        who did not have an equal amount of power at the time, were not able to
        contribute to the representation of themselves. Understanding the effect
        of one’s own biases on the identity of the Other, and acting to
        compensate for it, will allow us to create technologies which are more
        presentative of a broader spectrum of people. When applying this logic
        to the creation of technology, one could understand how the Facebook AI
        mistakenly recognised people of colour as primates. Facebook lacked the
        implementation of people of colour when considering the creation of
        their face recognition AI. This led to scandal, and offense from members
        of the community (BBC News, 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, data-art and techno-art are both art forms which are
        laden with messages which need to be decoded by the viewer. Whilst these
        art forms can broaden a viewer’s perspective, or provide new ideas for
        them to explore, the creator must be considerate of not only their own
        biases when creating an artwork, but additionally the effects of the
        messages within their work on others. When this is considered, as well
        as the effects on the viewers, one can create kinder technology which is
        more inclusive.
