        <h1 class="p-article-title">Summary of Data Visualisation</h1>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Aspects of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>
          In the 2020 article “Overview of Data Visualisation”, Li explores the
          different definitions of data visualisation from different
          perspectives of study, however, they note that in modern times data
          visualisation comprises of four aspects: namely, real-time
          interaction, on-the-fly processing, visual scalability and user
          assistance and personalisation. These four aspects mean that data
          visualisation must be able to support millions of interactions all
          whilst remaining in the response time of a few milliseconds,
          supporting on-the-fly visualisations over sets of raw data, finally,
          it has user customisation and other user designed features.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Data and Information</h2>
        <p>
          Data visualisation is further catagorised into information and
          scientific visualisation. Information data represents abstract
          information and scientific information represents scientific
          information (eg. the human body, the atmosphere, etc). Data itself is
          catagorised into primary and secondary data. Primary data is collected
          directly by the researcher, and secondary data is processed primary
          data for a specific intent. Primary data and secondary data can
          therefore be thought of as data and information, respectively. Data
          comprises of entities and relations. Entities refers to objects, and
          relations refers to the properties of the object. Relations usually do
          not exist independently. Information, on the other hand, comprises of
          three parts: information as an organized arrangement of facts or data,
          information presented as a means of understanding a situation or
          process, and design of control systems. These three parts determine
          how easily information can be extracted, how information relates to
          certain subjects or scenarios, and the feedback that a product gives.
          Li then goes on to give examples of common information and scientific
          visualisations – tables, charts, tress maps and simulations, volume,
          waveforms respectively. Overall, all these traditional types of data
          visualisation have characteristics of readability, recognizability and
          meaning, amongst others.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Human Interpretation and Understanding</h2>
        <p>
          Data visualisation relies on human perception and understanding, which
          means that data a visualisation effectiveness is determined by how
          well a particular person can interpret it. Li mentions Haeley’s 2007
          theories of preattentive processing.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Feature integration theory</h2>
        <p>
          Developed by Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade, this theory suggests
          human perceives a stimulus, features are “registered early,
          automatically, and in parallel, while objects are identified
          separately”. It was made to determine which properties are detected
          preatentively, and how the human brain performs this process.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Texton theory</h2>
        <p>
          Developed by Bela Julész, to study texture patterns and if features
          are detected by the human visual system. He determined that there are
          three textons. Elongated blobs: specific properties such as hue,
          orientation, and width. For example, line segments, rectangles,
          ellipses; terminators: ends of line segments; crossings of line
          segments. It is believed that only a difference in textons or in their
          density can be detected preattentively.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Similarity theory</h2>
        <p>
          This theory focuses on search time for perception. Search time depends
          on the amount of information needed to identify an object and how
          easily that object is distinguished from distractors.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Guided search theory</h2>
        <p>
          Made by JeremyWolfe, it is a two-stage model of visual processing in
          which initial parallel search mechanisms direct subsequent serial
          search mechanisms.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Although the main summarized text by Li primarily focuses on
          quantitative data, there is need to know how one might record or
          visualise qualitative data. Nelson (2006), suggests that this type of
          knowledge (qualitative) is knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge of
          how to, whereas quantitative knowledge is factual and “is typically
          articulated in a set of testable and falsifiable propositions”
          (Nelson, 2006). Nelson suggests ways in which one can access
          qualitative knowledge. In particular, he speaks about
          practice-as-research. This is used when words are unable to
          communicate the knowledge, however, workshop education affords
          insights into data. For example, you may be unable to describe to
          someone your process of riding a bicycle and how you keep your
          balance, however, as the researcher attempts to ride the bicycle on
          their own, they are able to learn and understand how to keep their
          balance. Qualitative data may further serve as evidence, for example,
          an eye witness statement or a survey about someone’s experiences.
