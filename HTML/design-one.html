        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Side navigation</h2>
        <p>
          The side navigation was chosen for this project based on the
          aesthetics of the website pictured below. Choosing a navigation bar in
          this format will provide users with expected logic when using devices
          with smaller screens - click on the burger button and you are
          presented with a menu pop up on the left side of your screen.

          />
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Colour</h2>
        <p>
          The colours used within this site consist of black, white, and shades
          in-between. This choice was made to make images stand out within the
          website. In terms of the data visualisations, this might become
          inportant when representing information within text - a purple bubble
          of 30%, for example, stands out within a site that uses mainly one
          colour.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Data visualisation</h2>
        <p>
          Despite there being no wireframe for the data visualisation at
          current, I have gathered ways in which I feel the data may be
          represented in a fun way, however, I feel that it may become cluttered
          and irrelevant depending on my chosen API.

          />
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-sub-head">Text</h2>
        <p>
          The text is not in a particular font, however, I would like to make
          use of a text which is both easy to read, whilst still still feeling
          different from the usual fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman. The
          navigation options make us of small case letters as text which is
          written in the same case (small or capital) is easier to read and
          makes the overall design feel more cohesive.
